## Authentication
In MealMaster, user authentication ensures that registered users can securely access their personal features, while guest users can explore basic functionalities. Here's a simplified description of how user authentication is managed, including session and cookie management, and its effect on navigation between different screens.

**Sign Up Process:**

  User Registration Form: Users fill out a form with their email, password, and name.
  
  Form Submission: When the form is submitted, the data is sent to the server with a `POST /SignUp` request.
  
  Server Processing:
- The server checks if the data is valid.
- If valid, the server saves the user information and creates a secure token (called JWT).
- The server sends back the user information and the token.
     
  Client-Side Handling: The client (the app) stores this token securely, either in an HttpOnly cookie or in local storage.

**Log In Process:**

  User Login Form: Users fill out a form with their email and password.
  
  Form Submission: When the form is submitted, the data is sent to the server with a `POST /LogIn` request.
  
  Server Processing:
- The server checks if the credentials are correct.
- If correct, the server creates a secure token (JWT) and sends it back.
  
  Client-Side Handling: The client stores this token securely.

**Log Out Process:**

  Log Out Request: The user clicks a log out button, which sends a `POST /LogOut` request to the server.
  Server Processing: The server invalidates the current token.
  Client-Side Handling: The client clears the stored token.

**Cookie / Session Management**

  Session Management with JWT
  Token Storage: The secure token (JWT) is stored on the client-side, either in an HttpOnly cookie or in local storage.
